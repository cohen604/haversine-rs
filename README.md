# Haversine-rs

This project is part of the [Performance Aware Programming](https://www.computerenhance.com) course, the goal is to implement the [Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) and then optimize the code according to what we learned in the course. The goal is not to find a better algorithm or change it to a more performant one, but rather to create a more performant code around the algorithm.
